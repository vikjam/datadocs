      <p class="category-description">This file contains data on the number of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students and all undergraduate students who receive different types of student financial aid, including grants and loans, from different sources at each institution. Sources and types of aid reported for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students include federal grants, Pell grants, other federal grants, state/local grants, grants from the institution, federal and nonfederal student loans. Types of aid reported for all undergraduates include total grants, pell grants and federal loans. Included are the total and average dollar amount of aid received by these students. This file also contains the average net price at each institution for the following two groups: (1) full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive grant and scholarship aid; and (2) full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive Title IV federal student aid. For public institutions, group 1 and group 2 include only students who pay the in-district or in-state tuition rate.

      <p class="category-description">This file contains data on the number of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students and all undergraduate students who receive different types of student financial aid, including grants and loans, from different sources at each institution. Sources and types of aid reported for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students include federal grants, Pell grants, other federal grants, state/local grants, grants from the institution, federal and nonfederal student loans. Types of aid reported for all undergraduates include total grants, pell grants and federal loans. Included are the total and average dollar amount of aid received by these students. This file also contains the average net price at each institution for the following two groups: (1) full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive grant and scholarship aid; and (2) full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive Title IV federal student aid. For public institutions, group 1 and group 2 include only students who pay the in-district or in-state tuition rate.
