    of student financial aid, including grants and loans, from different sources at
    each institution. Sources and types of aid reported for full-time, first-time
    degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students include federal grants, Pell
    grants, other federal grants, state/local grants, grants from the institution,
    federal and nonfederal student loans. Types of aid reported for all undergraduates
    include total grants, pell grants and federal loans. Included are the total and
    average dollar amount of aid received by these students. This file also contains
    the average net price at each institution for the following two groups: (1) full-time,
    first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive grant
    and scholarship aid; and (2) full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking
    undergraduate students who receive Title IV federal student aid. For public institutions,
    group 1 and group 2 include only students who pay the in-district or in-state
    tuition rate.
