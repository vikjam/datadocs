# Introduction

This is a sample implementation of a codebook. This codebook documents two datasets I have been working with. Data from Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and the College Scorecard, which overlaps with IPEDS for some variables.

Everything on this page is completely customizable. I have some ideas for further enhancements, including:

- Adding notes and comments on variables that documents issues encountered by users.
- For ID variables, listing tables that can be linked to it.
