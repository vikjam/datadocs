- description: One of the most common reasons students cite in choosing to go to college
    is the expansion of employment opportunities. To that end, data on the earnings

    the labor market outcomes of individuals attending institutions of higher education,
    data on cohorts of federally aided students were linked with earnings data from
    de-identified tax records and reported back at the aggregate, institutional level.
